<ul>
<li><a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a> - Forcing myself to properly learn Vim was one of the best decisions I ever made and has paid dividends.  Worth learning properly.  Not sure where to start?  Start with Drew Neil&rsquo;s two short books on the subject, <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition">Practical Vim</a> &amp; <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/modvim/modern-vim">Modern Vim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux#welcome-to-tmux">Tmux</a> - Tmux is admittedly less of a killer app now that most terminal emulators have support for splits and tabs.  Still, I find myself being lost without it.  I recommend <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux2/tmux-2">Tmux 2</a> by Brian P. Hogan if you want to learn it properly and quickly.  And <a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a> for defining what you want your session(s) to look like so you don&rsquo;t have to re-set-up everything every time you restart your computer.</li>
<li><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> - My life is in 1Password.  It&rsquo;s probably the single most useful piece of software I own that I happily pay $5/mo for.</li>
<li><a href="https://weechat.org/">Weechat</a> - Using IRC in 2020 may seem antiquated to some, particularly if you haven&rsquo;t been on there since the 90s.  But it&rsquo;s alive and well and has been incredibly helpful.  I&rsquo;ve tried many clients but Weechat has been the best of the pack.  It&rsquo;s daunting at first but the docs are great.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="macos-exclusive">macOS Exclusive</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> - a Spotlight replacement that is light years ahead of Spotlight.  If you take the time to read the docs and learn it you&rsquo;ll be rewarded.  It&rsquo;s <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> integration is particularly useful for engineers, which I wrote about <a href="https://jsatk.us/posts/how-i-code-alfred-and-dash/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> - Offline API docs and excellent search.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/">CalDigit TS3+</a> - I love this thing so much.  I bought one for work and home.  This is the missing piece that should come with every MacBook Pro since Apple decided &ldquo;pros&rdquo; don&rsquo;t have use for any ports other than USB-C.  With that said, it is amazing that through one USB-C cable from my MacBook Pro to the TS3+ I get ethernet, external keyboard, dual monitors, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://keyboard.io">Keyboard.io</a> - I went down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole a few years back when Apple switched to butterfly switches and various keys stopped working (they&rsquo;ve since <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kxmw5/apple-gives-up-on-its-worst-design-mistake-ever-the-butterfly-keyboard">switched back</a>).  I spent a not-insignificant amount of money trying out various mechanical keyboards.  Keyboard.io is the best.  The split keyboard thing weirded me out at first and the keyboard.io in particular has a learning curve.  But now that I&rsquo;ve had it for a few years I am grateful I made the switch.  Best keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever used by a long shot.</li>
