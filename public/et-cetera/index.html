Vim - Forcing myself to properly learn Vim was one of the best decisions I ever made and has paid dividends.  Worth learning properly.  Not sure where to start?  Go through vimtutor.  Next read Drew Neil&rsquo;s two short books on the subject, Practical Vim &amp; Modern Vim.
Tmux - Tmux is admittedly less of a killer app now that most terminal emulators have support for splits and tabs.  Still, I find myself being lost without it.  I recommend Tmux 2 by Brian P. Hogan if you want to learn it properly and quickly.  And tmuxinator for defining what you want your session(s) to look like so you don&rsquo;t have to re-set-up everything every time you restart your computer.
1Password - My life is in 1Password.  It&rsquo;s probably the single most useful piece of software I own that I happily pay $5/mo for.
Weechat - Using IRC in 2020 may seem antiquated to some, particularly if you haven&rsquo;t been on there since the 90s.  But it&rsquo;s alive and well and has been incredibly helpful.  I&rsquo;ve tried many clients but Weechat has been the best of the pack.  It&rsquo;s daunting at first but the docs are great.

Alfred - a Spotlight replacement that is light years ahead of Spotlight.  If you take the time to read the docs and learn it you&rsquo;ll be rewarded.  It&rsquo;s Dash integration is particularly useful for engineers, which I wrote about here.
Dash - Offline API docs and excellent search.
Marked - Markdown previewer.  I have been using this for 7&#43; years and produced countless PDFs with it.  If you prefer Markdown to LateX this is a must.  It&rsquo;s worth every penny.

CalDigit TS3&#43; - I love this thing so much.  I bought one for work and home.  This is the missing piece that should come with every MacBook Pro since Apple decided &ldquo;pros&rdquo; don&rsquo;t have use for any ports other than USB-C.  With that said, it is amazing that through one USB-C cable from my MacBook Pro to the TS3&#43; I get ethernet, external keyboard, dual monitors, etc.
Keyboard.io - I went down the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole a few years back when Apple switched to butterfly switches and various keys stopped working (they&rsquo;ve since switched back).  I spent a not-insignificant amount of money trying out various mechanical keyboards.  Keyboard.io is the best.  The split keyboard thing weirded me out at first and the keyboard.io in particular has a learning curve.  But now that I&rsquo;ve had it for a few years I am grateful I made the switch.  Best keyboard I&rsquo;ve ever used by a long shot.
