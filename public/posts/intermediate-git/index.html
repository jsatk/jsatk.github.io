It is a tutorial of beginner to intermediate to maybe a light dusting of advanced git topics and practices.
It is practical.

It is not philosophy or theory. (I will not be discussing the pros and cons of merge and rebase. Y&rsquo;all can fight that battle elsewhere.)
It is not super complex or overly archaic.
It is not preachy (See first point).
It is not in any way exhaustive. This is a list of git commands, tips, tricks, and tools I personally find super useful and use nearly every day.

This is a series of things I often discover people struggle with, don’t know how to do, or have bizarre work arounds to get this information. You may know some or all of these already. But I figured I’d write this up and hopefully get a conversation going around git. I hope you find something useful in here and I hope it saves you time. NOTE: I personally use Fish Shell. I’ve conveted any Fish Shell specific syntax to Bash as 90% of you reading this probably use Bash.">

<p>“But Jesse—this seems unnecessary. I can clearly see in git status that I have a commit that’s not pushed yet.” You’re correct. This isn’t the world’s greatest use-case example. However, I use this most often when I need to see what changes might be incoming or to diff between my branch and master. If I’ve been on a feature branch for a few days and want to see a diff between my feature branch and master doing <code>git diff master feature_branch</code> will only <code>diff</code> between my local copy of <code>master</code> and my <code>feature_branch</code>. What I do in these situations is this <code>git fetch origin &amp;&amp; git diff origin/master feature_branch</code>. The <code>fetch</code> here is important. (Note: If you’re unclear on the difference between <code>fetch</code> and <code>pull</code> I highly suggest you take 15 minutes to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/what-are-the-differences-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read up on it</a>.)</p>

<p>This comes up surprisingly a lot for me. I tend to use the show feature a lot more. A use case might be if I know a co-worker and I are working on the same file. He’s merged his branch into <code>master</code>, I’m on a <code>feature_branch</code>. I will then do a <code>git fetch &amp;&amp; git show origin/master:file/coworker/and/i/are/working/on.js</code>. This then lets me easily see if his new work then affects my current work and if lets me know if I need to course correct.</p>

<p>By default git stash does not stash untracked files. Throw a <code>-u</code> on the end. Also, <code>git stash list</code> shows you your stashes, however the default message it saves with it is the message of the latest commit and the branch you stashed it on. This is… super unhelpful. Make sure to add <code>save</code> to your <code>git stash</code> command and follow it with a message. You’re really smart. You’re also busy and you will totally forget what the hell is in your stashes if more than say 15 minutes pass. I promise you. Then when you come in the next day and run <code>git stash list</code> and see a list of stashes with commit messages that have nothing to do with the work in the stash you’ll want to scream.</p>

<p><code>git stash apply stash@{3}</code> will apply fourth (it’s zero-indexed) stash’s content to your current branch and the stash will remain in the stash list. However, <code>git stash pop stash@{3}</code> will remove the fourth stash from the list moving all stashes after it up one on the index. <code>pop</code> is probably what you most often want, but it’s also more dangerous for obvious reasons. If you would rather use <code>apply</code> you can saftely run <code>git stash drop stash@{3}</code> after you’re cool with getting rid of that stash.</p>

<p>With git stash list the stashes reindex after you remove a stash. Let’s say you have three stashes. If you try to do something like this <code>git stash drop stash@{1} &amp;&amp; git drop stash@{2}</code> this will fail because the stash at index 2 is now at index 1 after having dropped the stash at index 1. When removing multiple stashes remove from the highest numbered index on down or… just be really really careful.</p>

<p>I like to commit a lot and often. At the end of a feature branch I have a ton of shitty commits. It&rsquo;s just the way I work. Those aren&rsquo;t going to be helpful to anyone once this is merged to master. And some day if they find a bug and have to do a <code>git blame</code> and see that Jesse commited this code six months ago with the commit message &ldquo;WIP. Fixed shit.&rdquo; they are going to (rightfully) curse my name. Lets not be that person. Lets use interactive rebase.</p>
<pre><code>$ git rebase --interactive branch_you_want_to_rebase_against_typically_master # That's it! You can also use the shorthand -i flag.
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very, well, interactive mode. Git really holds your hand and gives you lots of nice messages. When you run that git will open your text editor and have a list of all of the commits on your branch that are not on the branch you&rsquo;re rebasing against.</p>
<pre><code># Rebase c4758c3..c4758c3 onto c4758c3 (1 command(s))
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like &quot;squash&quot;, but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out

<p>If your branch&rsquo;s commit history is a complete mess but you know you want what is there currently another branch (most likely master) <code>--squash</code> is your friend.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout branch_you_want_to_move_commit_to &amp;&amp; git cherry-pick 240982d # You don't need the full sha, just enough that git understands it.
</code></pre>
<p>Can be a tad dangerous. Specifically—git will assign a new sha to the cherry-picked commit. Which means git will now have record of two sha&rsquo;s with the same exact changes. Proceed with caution.</p>

<pre><code>$ git bisect start

# At this point git takes over and tells you how many rivisions to test. Through a series of good and bad confirmations it will then tell you the bad commit.
# Shoot off an email or slack message to the author with the commit sha or fix yourself if you're confident of the intended change in the commit or if you're the author
$ git bisect reset # DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS PLEASE. IF YOU FORGET YOU WILL BE VERY ANGRY LATER.

<p>Git is a tool. It is a means to an end. Not the end. Mastering your tools is essential in becoming a better and more efficient programmer. However, use whatever you feel more comfortable with. If you are happy with your GUI git app of choice then use it. Occassionally though these apps cause problems and you gotta jump into the commandline and get your hands dirty.</p>
